@errorHandling
Feature: Error handling
	As an API consumer
	I want consistent and meaningful error responses
	So that I can handle the errors correctly

	@foo
    Scenario: GET /foo request not found
        When I GET /foo
        Then response code should be 404
        And response header Content-Type should be application/json
        And response body should contain Resource not found

    @post-foo
    Scenario: POST /foo request not found
        When I POST to /foo
        Then response code should be 404
        And response header Content-Type should be application/json
        And response body should contain Resource not found
        
	@foobar
    Scenario: GET /foo/bar request not found
        When I GET /foo/bar
        Then response code should be 404
        And response header Content-Type should be application/json
        And response body should contain Resource not found
